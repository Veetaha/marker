    description: >
      If set to `true` then the action will only install `cargo marker`,
      and will skip running `cargo marker`. Use this if you want to run
      something more complex than just `cargo marker`. If you think there
      may be a frequent use case for running a different command then we will be
      glad if you open a feature request issue for that to extend the action input
      parameters.

    # Run the check with `--locked` only if there is a `Cargo.lock` file present in the
    # repository. Not everyone checks in the `Cargo.lock` file into the version control,
    # but if they do they would want this command to run with `--locked` to ensure that
    # the lock file is up to date.
